# rustydorf

This application is designed for displaying and manipulating dwarfs in Dwarf Fortress. It hopes to be a complete port and rewrite of Dwarf Therapist, providing enhanced functionality and a modern interface.

At this stage, it can only display serialized data from the game.

## Features

- Rust backend to interact with the Dwarf Fortress process.
- Basic Python GUI using a REST API for displaying data. My rationale for using the Qt binding for python is that it makes it easier to customize and update without having to do anything to the backend.

I dedicate this project to someone who will always be incredibly special to me. \
I look up to them, and without them this project would not be possible. I doubt I will even finish it, but they inspire me to keep going.
