# rustydorf

This application is designed for displaying and manipulating dwarfs in Dwarf Fortress. It aims to be a complete port and rewrite of Dwarf Therapist, providing enhanced functionality and a modern interface.

## Features

- Rust backend to interact with the Dwarf Fortress process.
- Basic Python GUI using a REST API for displaying data. My rational for using the Qt binding for python is that it makes it easier to customize and update without having to do anything to the backend.


###

This project is currently a work in progress. At this stage, it can only display serialized data from the game.
